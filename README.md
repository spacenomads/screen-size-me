# ScreenSize Me<span style="color:#ff6600;">!</span>

v1.1.0

ScreenSize Me! is a small application that helps web designers and developers with the issue of screen resolution and Pixel Ratio.

The problem is that when searching for the specifications of a device it is not clear that the total value of pixels is not the one returned by the browser.
So if a device has 2560x1440 pixels and a Pixel Ratio of 2, it returns 1280x720.
That is, the physical pixels do not correspond to those returned by a specific program, in this case, the browser.

I don't really care about Pixel Ratio that much, I want an online tool that I can go into with my device and it tells me the width and height in pixels of my screen and browser window. And this is what **ScreenSize Me<span style="color:#ff6600;">!</span>** does!
